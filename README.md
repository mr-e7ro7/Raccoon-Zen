# Raccoon_Zen
a compilation of the zen css i have perminantly borrowed.
these are not css that i made. just ones i found and use.
the current css comes form greeeen-dev(natsumi browser), TheBigWazz(pineapple fried), sameerasw(my-internet), tanay-kar(lacuna), aaaaannd idk who all gave me the rest, but they have my deepest gratitude

I stole animations from zen zero, rgb tabs from nebula
