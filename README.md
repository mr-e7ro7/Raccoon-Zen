the current css comes form greeeen-dev(natsumi browser), TheBigWazz(pineapple fried), sameerasw(my-internet), tanay-kar(lacuna), aaaaannd idk who all gave me the rest, but they have my deepest gratitude

and cool animations.


to get the old natsumi urlbar animation(assuming natsumi is already installed), go to natsumi>modules>natsumi-urlbar.css and replace the part under the title */*animations*/* (NOT the whole css) with the old animation css
