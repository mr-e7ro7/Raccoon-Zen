# my-stolen-zen-css
a compilation of the zen css i have collected.
these are not css that i made. just ones i found and use.
the current css comes form greeeen-dev(natsumi browser), TheBigWazz(pineapple fried), sameerasw(my-internet), tanay-kar(lacuna), aaaaannd idk who all gave me the rest, but they have my deepest gratitude

and cool animations.


to get the old natsumi urlbar animation(assuming natsumi is already installed), go to natsumi>modules>natsumi-urlbar.css and replace the part under the title */*animations*/* (NOT the whole css) with the old animation css


also i think this is just clean af

set zen.widget.macos.window-material to 1 in about config to get this kind of transparency

you can also change the primary color in natsumi-config.css, natsumi-library.css, and natsumi-pip.css to whatever you want. i use #4F93FF
